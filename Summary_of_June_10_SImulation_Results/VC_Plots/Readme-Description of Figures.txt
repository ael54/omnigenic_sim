Please look at Table 2 of the mansucript draft in overleaf for a refresher on the four different factors that were simulated: https://www.overleaf.com/project/65b7a575134bb6118c65cf9d

Please look at Figure 1 of the mansucript for a visualization of the forward-in-time simulation experiment.


There is one pdf per main effect level of each factor. The filename of each pdf desribes the level of the main effect of a particular Factor. For example “VC.Factor.A.Level.1.plot.trait.genetic.breeding.value.three.selection.types” shows the results for Level 1 of Factor A


Each pdf has three pages: one for each subpopulation/selection

Each page has three rows and four columns: 
-The top row is the trait value; the middle row is the genetic value; the bottom row is the breeding value. 
-The first (leftmost) column is the entire trait; the second column is the core components; the third column is the peripheral compoenets; the fourth column is the between core-peripheral episttaic component

The X-axis of each graph are the generations of selection (NOTE - generation 0 is the founder population - these will/should be the same in all graphs in a given pdf)

The Y-axis of each graph are log-transformed variance components
